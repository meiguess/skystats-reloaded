# SkyStats

Basically a profile viewer for the SkySim Minecraft Server [mc.skysim.sbs](http://discord.skysim.sbs).



## FAQ

#### Feature x is missing, but it's on SkyLea / SkyCrypt! Why isn't it on SkyStats?

I am trying to add most features to SkyStats, however it is really hard because of two reasons:
- SkySim's API provides much less information (for now) than Hypixel's API does
- I am a student, I have a life outside of my house (well not really but..) and it's really hard for me to spend my whole time working on SkyStats. Furthermore, I'm alone pretty much so it takes much longer, sorry!

#### Why doesn't the page work at all on my phone / tablet?

Yeah, I know it doesn't! I'm not much of a frontend developer myself and i kinda just copied the starting code from edemarz' repository, which isn't responsive at all. I can only guarantee that it works on big screens like PC's or Laptops. I'm trying to add it for phones and tablets soon though!

#### Can you add X and Y?

Open an Issue or refer to #suggestions on the Discord

#### Where can I ask a question that isn't listed!

On the Discord in #general! :)
